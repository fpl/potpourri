# Potpourri is a repository of quick & dirty scripts

Mixed scripts of doubtful usefulness written in deplorable languages for daredevils.

 - `smap/` some shell simple scripts to get daily SMAP L3/4 for a few years and until today.
 - `download_lai.py` - a simple script to download daily 10m LAI maps for any day and until today.
 - `create_ndvi.sh` - a simple script to create NDVI from Landsat by using PKTools.
 - `ease_coords2csv` - convert binary EASE2 grid coords to their ASCII form.
 - `rgb2idx.py` - sort of rgb2pct.py without dithering for a limited range of colors.
 - `get_saocom_acqdate.sh` - a simple script to get acquisition dates from a batch of SAOCOM files.
 - `create_manifest` - a simple script to create a manifest file for a directory with MD5SUMs.
 - `diffsplit` - split a unified diff in multiple patches. This is not splitdiff!
